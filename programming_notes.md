# Notes on Programming Languages

## What is a Programming Language?

- A programming language is a set of instructions given to a computer.
- Instructions are written line by line in a structured format.
- It enables communication between humans and computers.
- Examples include Python, Java, PHP, Go, C, C++, etc.
- Different languages suit different use cases, but the core logic is similar.

## Low Level Language

- Consists of binary code (0s and 1s) that computers directly understand.
- Includes machine code and assembly language.
- Used to communicate with hardware before high level languages existed.

## High Level Language

- Easier for humans to read and write.
- Abstracts away hardware details.
- Examples include Python, Java, C++.
- Uses compilers or interpreters to convert code into low level binary for execution.
